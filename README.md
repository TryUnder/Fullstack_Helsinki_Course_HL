# Fullstack_Helsinki_Course_HL

This repository is the record of exercises done by taking the course of Fullstack Developer organised by University of Helsinki. 
The repository itself is organised in a way that each individual folder represents the seperate part from the course. Each folder will be filled up with solved tasks.
